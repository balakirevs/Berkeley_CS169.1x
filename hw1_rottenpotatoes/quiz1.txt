1. In the Ruby expression a.foo, which calls method foo on receiver a, which of the following conditions affects whether the call succeeds?
  - (a) a responds to the foo method.
  - (b) a's class, or one of its superclasses or included modules, implements method_missing in a way that handles the foo method.

2. What is the result of executing the following code?
  - (c) 7

3. When the Ruby expression foo + bar is evaluated, which statement is ALWAYS true?
  - (a) bar is passed as an argument to foo's + method.

4. You are given the following short list of movies exported from an Excel comma-separated values (CSV) file. Each entry is a single string that contains the movie name in double quotes, zero or more spaces, and the movie rating in double quotes. For example, here is a list with three entries:

    movies = [%q{"Aladdin",   "G"},
              %q{"I, Robot", "PG-13"},
              %q{"Star Wars","PG"}]

Your job is to create a regular expression to help parse this list:

    movies.each do |movie|
      movie.match(regexp)
      title,rating = $1,$2
    end
    # => for first entry, title should be Aladdin, rating should be G, WITHOUT the double 
    # => quotes

You may assume movie titles and ratings never contain double-quote marks. Within a single entry, a variable number of spaces (including 0) may appear between the comma after the title and the opening quote of the rating.

Which of the following regular expressions will accomplish this? Check all that apply.

 - (c) regexp = /"(.*)", "(.*)"/ 

5. Class A is a subclass of Class B. Class B is a subclass of class C. a is an object of class A. b is an object of class B. Which ONE of the following Ruby expressions is NOT true?

  -(b) a.superclass == b.class

6. A valid DNA sequence consists of any number of A, G, C, and T bases. A valid RNA sequence consists of any number of A, G, C, and U bases. (Valid DNA sequences never contain U, and valid RNA sequences never contain T.) Which regular expression below matches an entire sequence that is either valid DNA or valid RNA?

- (c) /^[(ACGU)|(ACGT)]+$/

7. Which of the following statements about classes in Ruby are true?

  -(a) Array is an instance of Class

8. Given the following code:

      class Book
        attr_accessor :author
        attr_reader :title
        attr_writer :comments
        def initialize(author, title)
          @author = author
          @title = title
          @comments = []
        end
      end

      book = Book.new("Chuck Palahniuk", "Fight Club")

Which of the following snippets of code are valid?

- (a) "#{book.title} was written by #{book.author}."

9. True or False: The Agile lifecycle is the best model for all software development?

 - (b) False

10. Which of these statements are true regarding Modules in Ruby?

    Modules hold a collection of methods and constants
    Modules can inherit from classes
    Modules allow you to share functionality across classes

  - (c) (1) and (2)

11. Given a string s = "Hello: I`m a l33t programmer!!" what single line of Ruby will produce the array ["Hello", "m", "a", "l", "t", "programmer"]

 - (a) s.split(/[^a-zA-Z]/).reject{|e| e == "I" || e.empty?}

12. Consider the following code:

    def mystery_sequence(start1, start2, limit=4)
      yield start1
      yield start2
      nextval = start1 + start2
      1.upto(limit) do
        yield nextval
        nextval, start2 = nextval + start2, nextval
      end
    end

Assuming s is initially an empty array [], which call will cause s to have the value: [2,3,5,8,13,21] ?

 - (a) mystery_sequence(2,3) do |elt| ; s<<elt; end
